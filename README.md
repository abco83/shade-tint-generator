basic site to create tinds and shades / brighter colors

This “tool” calculates the shades and tints for any color, in addition it tries to make brighter versions of the color as well. When the calculated color is “corrected” e.g. the rgb value was set to max or min because it exceeded that value, the box will have an ugly border.

Functionality:

Copy any Hex or rgb code into the box the input field.
Input from rgb numbers, color picker or type in hex supported.
Click on any colored button to copy it’s hex code to clipboard.
Click on “Get RGB” to copy the rgb code to clipboard.
Information about the meaning of colors.
Change the text or border color of the calclulated color boxes.
Enable/disable recalculating from clicks on shades and tints.
Saves the calculated decimals while clicking through.
Calculate the negative of the current color.
2 x 20 examples to click on.
Random color selector.

I wanted to copy on click to brighter colors with the same percentages on Red, Green, Blue, instead of only compaired to white and black.
